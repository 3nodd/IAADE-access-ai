# IAADE â€“ Intelligent Access Automation & Decision Engine

IAADE is a backend system designed to automate the validation and routing of employee access requests using a combination of rule-based logic and machine learning. The goal is to reduce manual approval time, improve consistency, and minimize unnecessary workload on managers.

## Problem Statement

In many organizations, access requests are either reviewed manually or processed using fixed rules. This approach often leads to delays, inconsistent decisions, and added pressure on IT or management teams. There's also limited visibility into how access decisions are made or tracked.

## Solution Overview

IAADE streamlines the access request process by:
- Validating and parsing incoming access requests
- Scoring each request based on urgency, user behavior, and role eligibility
- Automatically approving or rejecting requests that are clearly valid or invalid
- Forwarding uncertain or high-risk requests to a manager with a recommendation
- Learning from manager responses over time to improve future decisions

## Outcomes

- Significant reduction in time spent reviewing requests
- Fewer interruptions for managers handling repeated low-risk approvals
- Improved transparency and consistency across departments
- A smarter and faster access request process that adapts over time
